      Epitech is a computer school created in 1999 that trains IT Experts. This training sought by companies is based on an innovative model that emphasizes three qualities that are increasingly required: adaptability, self-progression and a project-oriented workforce. To carry out this program, called Grande Ecole program,the students' course is divided into two parts. A first 2-year program will address the most technical topics in order to build a solid base and varied knowledge. The second course of the school is called the innovation cycle. It lasts 3 years, from the third to the fifth year of the Epitech program. It aims to develop a project, an expertise or a technology, and is structured of three stages: the idea and positioning, prototyping and feedback, and finally industrialization and commercialization. This project is called the Epitech Innovation Project (EIP).
